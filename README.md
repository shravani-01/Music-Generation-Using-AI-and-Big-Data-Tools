# Music-Generation-Using-AI-and-Big-Data-Tools
This project aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to generate high-quality music compositions using the MusicNet dataset and Big Data Tools.

We analyzed the MusicNet dataset, which provided valuable information about the distribution of ensembles and compositions across different composers. Solo piano emerged as the most common ensemble type, while Beethoven stood out as the dominant composer.
We leveraged the power of LSTM and GAN models for music generation, training them using GCP services such as GCP Bucket for data storage, GCP Dataproc, and Pyspark for distributed processing, GCP Notebooks for development, and FastAPI for deployment. 

We employed various callbacks in the training process, including learning rate scheduling, reducing learning rate on plateau, model checkpointing, and TensorBoard visualization. These callbacks played crucial roles in controlling the training process and monitoring model performance.

While we initially experimented with Elephas(Pyspark Library), an integration of Keras and Spark, we ultimately switched to TensorFlow for its flexibility, compatibility, and extensive community support. 

Overall, our journey through music generation using deep learning and GCP showcased the potential of these technologies in creating AI-powered music compositions. By combining cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, cloud computing resources, and efficient development and deployment tools, we unlocked new possibilities in music creation and expanded our understanding of the intersection between AI and music.

FastAPI is a Python framework for building APIs. Combined with GCP, we tried deploying our LSTM models.

We can explore advanced AI techniques such as reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks to further enhance the quality and diversity of the generated music compositions. Additionally, we can consider incorporating additional features and metadata into the models to capture more nuanced musical characteristics.
Incorporating real-time streaming data, allowing for dynamic and interactive music generation. This would involve implementing scalable and distributed streaming data processing frameworks such as Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.

Another interesting direction is to explore the application of transfer learning in music generation. By leveraging pre-trained models on large music corpora, we can transfer the learned knowledge and patterns to improve the performance and efficiency of our models.
